				<strong>Welcome to our newest concept made to simplify your employment process : JobMatch !</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				How much time did you spend looking at different websites to find a job as an employee ? And how much resources do you spend as an employer to recruit the right person ? This process can be very long and it can be hard to find the perfect match. JobMatch aims to help both the employees to find the right company for their next job and the employers to select the good profile to integrate their firm for short-term missions. We have two targets : on the one hand, we want to focus on people actively looking for a job, with some experience or skills to promote, and on the other hand, we target employers who need to find the right person for a specific job. Our users will be people from 25 to 40 years old, who grew up with technology, trust it and know how to use it. This is an ambitious project because this range represents the employees and the managers of tomorrow. We already have some competitors on the market but our unique value proposition is that this service depends only on skills and experiences, there is no judgement on physical attributes. Moreover, we are the only ones to promote this mechanic of matching people if both sides are interested.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>So now, join us and find your JobMatch</strong>
